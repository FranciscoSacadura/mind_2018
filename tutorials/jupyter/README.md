# Jupyter Tutorial  

This is a brief tutorial overview of jupyter notebooks and jupyter lab. You can download the notebooks in this repo to follow along yourself, although the slideshow will not work without installing [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE).  

However, you can view the rendered slideshow [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/ejolly/mind_2018/blob/master/tutorials/jupyter/Intro_To_Jupyter_Notebooks.ipynb/).
